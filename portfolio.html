	    <h2>In this program, we use numerous pictures that we have set to become turtles, as the nest, and the chicken. The chicken asks how many eggs to lay, and what color each of them should be, and lays them into the nest below it. The eggs randomly have a chance of staying as eggs, turning into omelets, or becoming chicks.

	    <h2>
Our plan for the game is to do 2048 Minions so we will use our knowledge of  onkeypress function, from the turtle escape maze we learned to use the similar functions that we will use to move the turtle/game, use functions with and without parameters, and we will use a background image for the 2048 map. Overall, we will create a game like 2048 but instead of numbers, combine alike minions!
